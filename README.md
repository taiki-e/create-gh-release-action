## Usage

This action creates GitHub Releases based on changelog that specified by `changelog` option.

Currently, changelog format and supported tag names have the following rule:

- This action uses [parse-changelog] to parse changelog.
  Only the changelog format accepted by [parse-changelog] is supported.

  Basically, [Keep a Changelog][keepachangelog] and similar formats are
  supported, but we recommend checking if [parse-changelog] can parse your
  project's changelog as you expected.

  [If the `changelog` option is not specified, the changelog is ignored and only the release created.](#example-workflow-no-changelog)

- The supported tag format is `v?MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH(-PRERELEASE)?(+BUILD_METADATA)?`.
  (leading "v", pre-release version, and build metadata are optional.)
  This is based on [Semantic Versioning][semver]

### Example workflow: Basic usage

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: taiki-e/create-gh-release-action@v1
        with:
          # (Optional) Path to changelog.
          changelog: CHANGELOG.md
        env:
          # (Required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Example workflow: Create a draft release

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: taiki-e/create-gh-release-action@v1
        with:
          # (Optional) Path to changelog.
          changelog: CHANGELOG.md
          # (Optional) Create a draft release.
          # [default value: false]
          draft: true
        env:
          # (Required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Example workflow: Custom title

You can customize the title of the release by `title` option.

*[Example of the created release.](https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project/releases/tag/v1.0.4)*

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: taiki-e/create-gh-release-action@v1
        with:
          # (Optional)
          changelog: CHANGELOG.md
          # (Optional) Format of title.
          # [default value: $tag]
          # [possible values: variables $tag, $version, and any string]
          title: $version
        env:
          # (Required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Example workflow: No changelog

If the `changelog` option is not specified, the changelog is ignored and only the release created.

*[Example of the created release.](https://github.com/openrr/urdf-viz/releases/tag/v0.23.1)*

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: taiki-e/create-gh-release-action@v1
        env:
          # (Required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Example workflow: Reject releases from outside of main branch

You can reject releases from commits not contained in branches that match the specified pattern by using `branch` option.

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.*

jobs:
  create-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: taiki-e/create-gh-release-action@v1
        with:
          # (Optional) Path to changelog.
          changelog: CHANGELOG.md
          # (Optional) Reject releases from commits not contained in branches
          # that match the specified pattern (regular expression)
          branch: main
        env:
          # (Required) GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
