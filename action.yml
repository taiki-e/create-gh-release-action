description: GitHub Action for creating GitHub Releases based on changelog

inputs:
  changelog:
    description: Path to changelog (variables `$tag`, `$version`, `$prefix`, and any string)
    required: false
  allow_missing_changelog:
    description: >
      If true, it will create the GitHub release with an empty notes for the changelog if the changelog.md file does not
      have the appropriate version in it.  By default, this action will fail if the version tagged is not found in the
      changelog file.
    required: false
    default: false
  title:
    description: Format of title (variables `$tag`, `$version`, `$prefix`, and any string)
    required: false
    default: '$tag'
  draft:
    description: Create a draft release ('true' or 'false')
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  branch:
    description: Reject releases from commits not contained in branches that match the specified pattern (regular expression)
    required: false
  prefix:
    description: >
      An optional pattern that matches a prefix for the release tag, before the
      version number.

      If a prefix is provided, an optional '-' character is permitted (but not
      required) between the prefix and the version number.   For example, the
      tags 'my-crate-v0.1.2' and 'my-crate0.1.0' both have the prefix 'my-crate'.

      This is interpreted as a bash-style regular expression, so it may be used
      to match multiple prefix strings. Therefore, literal characters that
      are part of bash's regular expression syntax, such as `$`, `^`, `[`, `]`,
      `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, and `|` must be escaped if they occur in the prefix
      pattern.

      If a prefix pattern is provided, the portion of the tag that matched the
      prefix can be interpolated into `title` and `changelog` via the `$prefix`
      variable.
    required: false
    default: ''
  token:
    description: >
      GitHub token for creating GitHub Releases.

      If not set this option, the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable will be used.
    required: false
  ref:
    description: >
      Fully-formed tag ref for this release.

      If not set this option, the GITHUB_REF environment variable (automatically set by GitHub Actions) will be used.
    required: false

outputs:
  computed-prefix:
    description: >
      The computed prefix, including '-' and 'v' if found.
  version:
    description:
      The version number extracted from the tag. The tag name is a concatenation of computed-prefix
      and version.
